    "A linear relationship between two variables is one in which the scatterplot of them looks roughly like a line.  *Linear regression* is a method for modelling how a *dependent variable* linearly depends on one or more *independent variables*.  The dependent variable (also called a *response variable* and many other things) is what we are trying to model or predict, and is usually denoted $Y$.  The independent variables (also called *explanatory* or *input variables*) are the information we are using to make the predictiong, and are usually denoted $X_1, X_2, ...$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The linear relationship is: $$Y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X_1 + \\beta_2 X_2 + ... + \\beta_n X_n + \\epsilon$$\n",
    "where $\\epsilon$ represents the error.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, $Y, X_1, X_2, ..., X_n$ are *random variables* which is what mathematical variables that can take different values with different probabilities are called.\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear regression finds the coefficients $\\beta_0, \\beta_1, ..., \\beta_n$ so that the sum of the squares of the error term for each data observation is minimized (as small as possible).\n",
