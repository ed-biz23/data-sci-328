    "This assignment uses the weather data from Lab 1, from [https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/us-weather-history](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/us-weather-history).  We used the KNYC.csv in Lab 1, and will also use KCLT.csv, which is the weather data for Charlotte, NC, in this assignment.\n",

    "This assignment will look at different ways to predict the actual maximum daily temperature in New York using linear regression.  The actual maximum temperature was the maximum temperature recorded on that day.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Predicting the NYC actual max temperature from the NYC average max temperature:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    a. Use regplot from Seaborn to create a scatter plot of the average max temperature (on x axis) vs. the actual max temperature (on y axis) with the regression line.  Do you think this data has a linear relationship?\n",
    "    \n",
    "    b. Compute the linear regression model where the independent variable is the average max temperature and the dependent variable is the actual max temperature.  What is the equation for the linear model?  What proportion of the variance is explained by the model (R-squared)?\n",
    "    \n",
    "    c. Plot a histogram of the residuals of your model from part b.  Describe their distribution.  Based on this and your results from parts a and b, do you think this linear model is a good fit?  Why or why not?\n",
    "    \n",
    "2. Predicting the NYC actual max temperature from the Charlotte actual max temperature:\n",
    "    Note:  To easily perform the following analysis, add the column of actual max temperatures from the Charlotte weather data to your NYC weather dataframe.  \n",
    "    ex.  `nyc_weather_df[\"name_of_new_column\"] = charlotte_weather_df[\"actual_max_temp\"]`\n",
    "    \n",
    "    a. Use regplot from Seaborn to create a scatter plot of the Charlotte actual max temperature (on x axis) vs. the NYC actual max temperature (on y axis) with the regression line.  Do you think this data has a linear relationship?\n",
    "    \n",
    "    b. Compute the linear regression model where the independent variable is the average max temperature and the dependent variable is the actual max temperature.  What proportion of the variance is explained by the model?\n",
    "    \n",
    "    c. Predict the NYC actual max temperature if the Charlotte max temperature is 32F, 60F, and 80F.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    d. Plot a histogram of the residuals of your model from part b.  Describe their distribution.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    e. Make a scatter plot of the NYC actual max temperaturs (x axis) vs. the residuals from your linear model.  If you are using `plt.scatter()` you can add a horizontal line to your plot at 0 with the code `plt.axhline(0)`.  What do you notice about how the residuals are distributed above and below this line?  What tempertures will be overestimated by this model?  What temperatures will be underestimated by this model?\n",
    "    \n",
    "    f. Based on the previous parts, do you think this linear model is a good fit?\n",
    "    \n",
    "3. Predicting the NYC actual max temperature from both the average max temperature and the Charlotte actual max temperature:\n",
    "    a. Compute a linear regression model with both the average max temperature and the Charlotte actual max temperature as the independent variables.  What proportion of variance is explained by this model?\n",
    "    \n",
    "    b. Plot a histogram of the residuals. Describe their distribution.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    c. Make a scatter plot of the NYC actual max temperatures (x axis) and the fitted NYC actual max temperatures (y axis).  What do you notice about the plot?"
